# Demokritos: Interactive, Community-Centred, Self-Improving Shader Generation using Large Language Models

While LLMs have shown effectiveness in generating code for various languages and contexts, producing shaders—specialised GPU programs essential for computer graphics rendering—from user-provided descriptions remains a complex challenge. Demokritos leverages LLM-generated models to create custom shaders based on user input, providing a seamless experience for generating and rendering shaders directly in-browser via WebGL.

Users can generate shaders by simply describing their desired visual effects, and the app will interpret and convert those descriptions into working shader code. Additionally, users can render and evaluate the results in real-time, contributing to the refinement of shader prompts and expanding a collaborative library of effective examples.
