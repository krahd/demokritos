This application leverages OpenAIâ€™s GPT to create custom shaders based on user input, providing a seamless experience for generating and rendering shaders directly in-browser via WebGL.

Users can generate shaders by simply describing their desired visual effects, and the app will interpret and convert those descriptions into working shader code. Additionally, users can render and evaluate the results in real-time, contributing to the refinement of shader prompts and expanding a collaborative library of effective examples.
